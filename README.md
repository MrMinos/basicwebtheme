# Basic Web Theme

Basic Web Theme is based on the web design I've arrived at over the
past few months for all of my websites, after spending the past
several years chipping away useless design elements from my sites.

The goals of Basic Web Theme is to provide usablility on desktop and
mobile, without distractions.

Ideally, the theme will only provide styling rules where doing so
improves upon the usablility of the system defaults. For example, to
use a readable column width on wide devices, scale content to mobile
viewports, and provide minimal styling for block quotes, code blocks
and tables.

This Hugo theme implementation of Basic Web Theme includes templates
for:

- homepage with an option to list children from another page

- list pages with full or truncated content

- single pages (e.g. a single post)

- standalone pages (e.g. about page, signup form, etc.)

- taxonomy partial template to list taxonomy terms (e..g tags) at
  bottom of page

- footer with auto-generate menu and "last updated" date

- taxonomy term list page

- taxonomy posts list page

- shortcode for showing a table from a data template

- shortcode for including a newsletter signup form

- 404 page

The example site gives shows how to use all of the templates in
the Hugo theme, shows how to use taxonomy, menus, shortcodes, and data
templates, and demonstrates the styling of various elements.
