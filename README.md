# Basic Web Theme

No one is impressed by your cool web design.

The Basic Web Theme is simple, minimal and usable.

The goal of this theme is to use default browser styles as much as
possible. Styles are tweaked to improve usability: limiting column
width, scaling for mobile devices, making columns look nice, scrolling
code blocks properly, etc.
